# Interactive Task Manager

This is the Interactive Task Manager iOS exercise take home project. Built fully in SwiftUI and utilising Core Data for data persistence, it supports dark mode, both iPhone and iPad UI and sorting of data within Core Data.

Further improvements can be made including providing an app wide accent colour that the user picks and filtering of tasks within a list.
